# Advance-Market-Segmentation
Developed a customer segmentation model using unsupervised learning techniques on a shopping trends dataset. Applied data preprocessing, handled missing values, and implemented one-hot encoding and feature scaling. Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and designed an autoencoder neural network to extract compressed latent features. Performed KMeans clustering on the latent space and evaluated model performance using the silhouette score. Visualized customer segments in 2D for insightful interpretation and pattern discovery.
